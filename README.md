# Interactive-English-Dictionary
This project is about a Graphical User Interface I built for an interactive dictionary using Python's Tkinter. The dictionary is relatively interactive as in if you misspell a word, the program suggests the closest correct word to the misspelled one. For example, if you typed in "comduter", the program would ask if your word is "computer".
